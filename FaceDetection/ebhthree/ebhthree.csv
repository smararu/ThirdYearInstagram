Today, at Mama's funeral, I will read it again. And though it is impossible to put into words how much this divine woman means to me, I will add on to that piece and give it a try: • I don't know how to build a lighthouse. • And I don't know why everyone is telling me that they are sorry for my loss. • I am never going to lose my grandmother. • It would be impossible to lose someone who is embedded in me so deep it's like I swallowed a stone. • I cannot ever get it out and it will stay with me until I die, too. • Every once in a while, right as I am about to cry, it wells up and gets caught in my throat and dams the water surely about to break. • In a way I think that's Mama telling me ""It's okay, sweetie. Don't cry."" • I just wish I could reach down and take that stone out of me and carry it to</p>",148,12
