This week, the goal is to take photos and videos that capture moments from your daily life, as in this featured photo from @_nguan_. Here are a few tips to get you started: As you go about your routine, note the shapes, shadows and colors you pass by. What details stand out when you pay attention? Take portraits of the people you regularly spend time with, like your family, friends, neighbors and co-workers. A picture is worth a thousand words. Use your camera to explain a part of your daily life and culture to someone who lives on the other side of the world. PROJECT RULES: Please add the <a href=""http://picbear.com/tag/whpmyeveryday"" title=""posts tagged as whpmyeveryday"">#whpmyeveryday</a> hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured</p>",1038958,3808

Even murals. “I love to go to a place, take something that’s drab and add a little bit of color to it collectively with good people who want to share in an experience,” says Dallas, who prefers to let the walls speak to him — rather than go into the process with a set plan or crew. “I just want it to be participatory.
