I’ve grown more comfortable in my skin and body, and it’s changed the way I’ve seen people and the world.” Her advice to others? “Self-confidence comes differently for everyone. Being confident in your skin takes time and learning. Stay true to yourself and most importantly, keep an open mind. People are different, and when you accept that, you can accept your differences.” <a href=""http://picbear.com/tag/nationalbodyconfidenceday"" title=""posts tagged as nationalbodyconfidenceday"">#nationalbodyconfidenceday</a></p>",684282,8110

This week, the goal is to take photos and videos that capture moments from your daily life, as in this featured photo from @_nguan_. Here are a few tips to get you started: As you go about your routine, note the shapes, shadows and colors you pass by. What details stand out when you pay attention? Take portraits of the people you regularly spend time with, like your family, friends, neighbors and co-workers. A picture is worth a thousand words. Use your camera to explain a part of your daily life and culture to someone who lives on the other side of the world. PROJECT RULES: Please add the <a href=""http://picbear.com/tag/whpmyeveryday"" title=""posts tagged as whpmyeveryday"">#whpmyeveryday</a> hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project. If you include music in your video submissions, please only use music to which you own the rights. Any tagged photo or video taken over the weekend is eligible to be featured</p>",1063463,3864

This weekend, the goal is to take photos and videos capturing the signs of a new season, as in this featured photo from Daniel Taipale (@dansmoe). Here are some tips to get you started:  Whether you’re in the Northern Hemisphere or the Southern, nature transforms the landscape this time of year.

Show us how you welcome the new season through traditions like autumn pumpkin-carving or planting a new garden. Reflect on what other transitions are taking place in your life, from new classes to new sports seasons.

It’s kind of a game of seeing new places, remembering things, always using your brain.” He’s seen lots of the world but credits his hometown as an influence to his approach: “I find it really quiet here, but in a way that’s good.

This week, the goal is to create photos and videos that capture energy and movement, as in this featured photo by Filipe Costa (@filipefoto). Here are some tips to get you started: Use Instagram’s creative tools to showcase kinetic energy in your daily life. Try a Boomerang of a morning running group or a Hyperlapse of an arena filling up with fans. Or make a Rewind in Instagram Stories of your dog playing fetch then share your video to your feed. Decide on a type of movement you want to focus on — sporting events, urban commutes, fall activities like apple picking — and go get in on the action. Let your camera lens draw your eye toward the most animated parts of the setting. Consider a scene that might at first glance appear calm and still. Where can you find the subtle forces of energy, and how can you highlight them in a single image?

I wanted to be a part of it.” Long before he went into comedy professionally, Stephen had a loyal audience of one: his mother. “She was a great guide for my artistic interests and was the ultimate person to make laugh,” he says.

Here are some tips to get you started: Are you heading out this weekend for some camping, hiking or biking? No matter what hemisphere you live in, the seasons are hinting at change, making it the perfect time of year to get outside. Take photos of your favorite moments. The outdoors come in many shapes and sizes, from a backcountry trek to a small urban garden. Show us your own slice of nature, big or small. Getting outside can often require a fair amount of preparation and consideration — packing gear, studying maps and preparing food. Show us your process through videos and Boomerangs.

Wherever your reveries take you, here’s how to get started: Create dreamlike compositions with textures such as gauzy curtains, or seek out otherworldly settings, like a foggy morning or a reflective pond. Does fantasy inspire your makeup and fashion choices (or even those of a pet)? Show off your most imaginative styles, or create a new personality and a look to match. Start in your Instagram Stories camera to experiment with transforming the world around you with tools like stickers and face filters, and then share your favorite creation to your feed. PROJECT RULES: Please add the <a href=""http://picbear.com/tag/whpimagine"" title=""posts tagged as whpimagine"">#whpimagine</a> hashtag only to photos and videos taken over this weekend and only submit your own visuals to the project.

Your imagination can take you on an adventure. Show us what that ride looks like by revealing some tricks or ways you motivate yourself to dive headfirst into a new project.

This weekend, the goal is to take photos and videos of the good food and better company you find in the kitchen, as in this featured photo by Hedi Gharrat (@h.rebel). Here are some tips to get you started: Visit the kitchens where your favorite meals are made: Re-create a family recipe at a relative’s house, capture the tried and true pots and pans hanging above your kitchen sink or the scars on a friend’s cheese board at Friday night dinner. People tend to gather in a home’s kitchen. Record Boomerangs or videos that capture the energy of a group of family members and friends around food and drink. Kitchens don’t have to exist between four built walls. What are some nontraditional, makeshift kitchens you found yourself in this weekend, like a street food cart or a campfire?

At home in Pune, India, his family spoke Bengali — but in class, his peers spoke Marathi, Pune’s provincial language. “I couldn’t understand nor speak Marathi,” says Debangshu, “so I started drawing to communicate. I showed people my drawings, the stuff that I actually wanted to tell them.” As he grew older, he honed his craft through online videos and tutorials. He picked up his first paid gig, an illustration for a Bengali magazine cover, at 14 and has been freelancing ever since. “Everything I’ve learned has come from the online community,” says Debangshu, who’s now 18. The internet, he believes, is breaking down the barriers to information and opportunities that the gatekeepers in his country formerly restricted to the elites. “Ten, 20 years ago, you had to wait for somebody to teach you a skill, you had to have access to books and stuff,” he says. “But now,</p>",618336,2339

After moving to Texas to pursue his dream of becoming a professional dancer, Harper, now 25 years old, has since realized that dream as a demi-soloist with the Houston Ballet. “It’s my goal to highlight the ballet world and bring it to different audiences,” says Harper, an extremely active voice in the social media dance world. “I want to show that we have our own interests and likes.” To accomplish this, Harper frequently films photos and videos he calls “The Pre Show,” showing himself and his fellow dancers preparing for performances, and creates viral videos of himself in bubblegum-pink heels — dancing, vogueing and walking on the treadmill. “These are expressions of my personality and extensions of what I love to do,” says</p>",592616,6223

You could say art was a way for me to retreat into a fantasy world of my own making.” These days, Jon paints, draws, animates and even writes as a full-time job — and also unleashes his creativity on Instagram Stories, adding googly-eyed creatures into the regular world and creating them out of inanimate objects with tools like markers and eraser brushes. “I’ve unlocked a part of my brain that allows me to anthropomorphize everything,” he says. “If there’s anything I’d like people to take from my work, it’s that it’s fun to be creative.
